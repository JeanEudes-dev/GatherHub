- Participation statistics

### ‚úÖ Security & Permissions

- Authentication required for all operations
- Object-level permissions for voting
- Custom permission classes
- Proper error handling and validation

### ‚úÖ Performance

- Optimized database queries with prefetch_related
- Efficient vote counting
- Minimal database hits for vote summaries

### ‚úÖ Integration

- Seamless integration with existing Event and TimeSlot models
- Enhanced Event API responses with vote data
- Admin interface for vote management

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### ‚úÖ Verification Status

All components have been verified to work correctly:

- ‚úÖ Models and relationships
- ‚úÖ Serializers and validation
- ‚úÖ ViewSets and API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Custom permissions
- ‚úÖ Integration with events system
- ‚úÖ URL configuration

### ‚úÖ Test Coverage

Tests cover all major functionality:

- Model creation and constraints
- Serializer validation
- API endpoint responses
- Permission enforcement
- Business rule validation

## üîÆ Ready for Next Steps

The voting system is fully prepared for:

- **Real-time WebSocket integration** (Task 6)
- **Production deployment**
- **Additional voting features** (voting deadlines, voting weights, etc.)
- **Advanced analytics and reporting**

## üìä System Status: PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ

The GatherHub Voting System is now fully operational and ready for user interaction. All requirements have been met and the system provides a solid foundation for community-driven event scheduling.
