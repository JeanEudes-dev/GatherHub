# Event Management API - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Event Management API for GatherHub with full CRUD operations, proper permissions, slug-based routing, and Markdown support.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Serializers (`apps/events/serializers.py`)

- **EventListSerializer**: Summary data for event listing with creator info and timeslot count
- **EventDetailSerializer**: Detailed view with Markdown HTML rendering and nested timeslots
- **EventCreateSerializer**: Event creation with validation and timeslot support
- **EventUpdateSerializer**: Event updates with title uniqueness validation
- **EventLockSerializer**: Event locking functionality
- **TimeSlotSerializer**: Timeslot management with vote count preparation
- **UserSummarySerializer**: Creator information serialization

### 2. ViewSets (`apps/events/views.py`)

- **EventViewSet**: Full CRUD operations with:
  - Slug-based lookup
  - Search and ordering capabilities
  - Custom lock action
  - Proper permission controls
- **TimeSlotViewSet**: Nested timeslot management with:
  - Event-scoped queries
  - Draft-only modifications
  - Creator-only access

### 3. Permissions (`apps/events/permissions.py`)

- **IsEventCreatorOrReadOnly**: Users can only edit their own events
- **CanModifyEventContent**: Prevents editing locked events
- **CanModifyTimeSlot**: Prevents editing timeslots for locked events

### 4. URL Structure (`apps/events/urls.py`)

```
GET    /api/v1/events/                    # List all events (paginated)
POST   /api/v1/events/                    # Create new event
GET    /api/v1/events/{slug}/             # Get event details
PUT    /api/v1/events/{slug}/             # Update event (creator only)
PATCH  /api/v1/events/{slug}/             # Partial update event
DELETE /api/v1/events/{slug}/             # Delete event (creator only)
POST   /api/v1/events/{slug}/lock/        # Lock event (creator only)

GET    /api/v1/events/{slug}/timeslots/     # List event timeslots
POST   /api/v1/events/{slug}/timeslots/     # Add timeslot to event
GET    /api/v1/events/{slug}/timeslots/{id}/ # Get timeslot details
PUT    /api/v1/events/{slug}/timeslots/{id}/ # Update timeslot
DELETE /api/v1/events/{slug}/timeslots/{id}/ # Delete timeslot
```

### 5. Business Logic & Validation

- ✅ Event titles must be unique per user
- ✅ Auto-generation of unique slugs from titles
- ✅ Markdown description support with HTML rendering
- ✅ TimeSlots must be in the future when created
- ✅ Cannot add/edit timeslots for locked events
- ✅ Cannot unlock events once locked
- ✅ Only event creators can modify their events

### 6. Features Implemented

- **Search & Filtering**: Search by title and description
- **Pagination**: Proper pagination for event listing
- **Markdown Support**: Full Markdown to HTML conversion
- **Nested Timeslots**: Timeslots included in event detail responses
- **Creator Information**: Full creator details in responses
- **Vote Count Support**: Prepared for Task 4 voting system
- **Ordering**: Sort by created_at, updated_at, title
